## Master Thesis

The main theme of this Master Thesis in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano is Bitcoin & Blockchain Technologies.

I am currently working on the basic implementative aspects in order to develop my thesis work:

- How to run a Bitcoin core node from command line ( Linux based systems ): [Run_Bitcoin_node](https://github.com/AndreaBrandoli90/MasterThesis/blob/master/Run_Bitcoin_node.md)
- How to connect multiple regtest nodes ( under the same network ): [Multiple_regtest_nodes](https://github.com/AndreaBrandoli90/MasterThesis/blob/master/Multiple_regtest_nodes.md)
- How to timestamp with OpenTimestamps Client: [Use_OTS_Client](https://github.com/AndreaBrandoli90/MasterThesis/blob/master/Use_OTS_Client.md)
- How to run an OpenTimestamps Server locally: [Use_OTS_Calendar](https://github.com/AndreaBrandoli90/MasterThesis/blob/master/Use_OTS_Calendar.md)
