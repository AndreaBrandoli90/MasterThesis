## Master Thesis

The main theme of this Master Thesis in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano is Bitcoin & Blockchain Technologies.

I am currently working on the basic implementative aspects in order to develop my thesis work:

- How to run a Bitcoin core node from command line ( Linux based systems )
- How to connect multiple regtest nodes ( under the same network )
- How to use OpenTimestamps Client
- How to run an OpenTimestamps Server locally
