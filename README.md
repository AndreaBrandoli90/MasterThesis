1. **Does the OTS proof reach the block Merkle Tip or just the transaction Merkle Tip ?**

OTS proof reaches the block Merkle Tip. The proof consists in a sequence of commitment operations like "sha256", "append", "prepend". These operations are the cryptographic path that proves that *d* commits to a certain block header. (More info here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenTimestamps>).

Another confirmation of this fact is in the article of P.Todd: [OpenTimestamps: Scalable, Trust-Minimized, Distributed Timestamping with Bitcoin](https://petertodd.org/2016/opentimestamps-announcement) which says: "*Each per-file timestamp is simply the list of commitment operations that comprise the path up the first merkle tree, then up the Bitcoin blockâ€™s merkle tree, to finally get to the block header.*"
